        <span><h1>What is a Developed Nation? Debunking the UN's Country Classification System.</h1> <a href=".\about.html" id="fillbutton">About Page</a></span>
        <p>People often hear concepts like nation development thrown around (underdeveloped, developing, third-world, terms like that)
            but the reality is that many of these classifications are not made the way that you might think. Countries are separated into three categories:
            Developing, Economies In Transition, and Developed based off what the UN calls "Basic Economic Conditions".

        <div><p>Take the time to look at the map below! For every country that we have information available from
            the WorldBank Dataset, clicking on the country will change the color to represent its level of 
            development according to the legend on the bottom right.
            Furthermore, hovering over different countries will show you relevant statistics to that nation's
            citizen welfare, like the accessibility of different commodities and the life expectancies of its people.
            <br><br>Try and take some time to make judgements on what you think a nation's rightful level of development would be based
            off these statistics-- what are the things that lead you to believe one nation is more modern than the other?
            You might be surprised to find that the United Nations Development Reports might have some very different ideas of what makes
            a nation developed than you do. Do you see any trends in terms of the way things are classified?

        <div><h1>Important Terms:
            <ul>
                <li>GDP per Capita w/PPP refers to GDP per Capita calculated with regards to <b>Purchasing Power Parity</b>,
                a measure of how much a dollar can buy in that nation. This helps to account for things like inflation
                and exchange rates.</li>
                <li>Life Expectancies are split based on male and female in the dataset. It is important to consider the way
                that they are calculated; deaths during childbirth or early child years have contributed disproportionately
                to the measures of mean life expectancy throughout history.
                </li>
                <li>CPI or <b>Consumer Price Index</b> are measures of inflation essentially, or the average change in the price
                of a designated "consumer basket of goods and services".
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>The Scatterplot above displays the correlation between % of GDP deriving from agriculture
            versus % deriving from manufacturing and industry. There are a few trends noticeable here,
            namely that countries classified as developed all-too-frequently have extremely low levels
            of GDP deriving from their agriculture. Looking through the scatterplot, it's also apparent that
            many of these developed countries' sums don't even get close to 100%. Taking a quick glance at
            the underlying data, we can make the assumption that much of this unaccounted for GDP comes from 
            taxation, imports, and investment. However, these are not indicative of the ways that a society operates,
            so we opted to use agriculture, industry, and manufacturing.
